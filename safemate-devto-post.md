## üß† Smart Architecture

One of the most innovative aspects of SafeMate is its smart fallback system:

- **Secure emergency protocols** with verification steps

## üí° Overcoming Challenges

Building SafeMate wasn't without obstacles:

- **Mobile audio limitations**: We developed custom handlers to overcome browser autoplay restrictions
- **Real-time GPS accuracy**: Balancing precision with battery efficiency required careful optimization
